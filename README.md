# GrammarChecker
A simple Grammar Checker, written in Java, that intakes a sentence and checks it against 10+ grammar rules to see if it complies with all of them.

The GrammarFiles folder contains three free textfiles we found on the web. Unfortunately, I don't couldn't find the links (sorry). However, they have all been modified with additional words as the original 90K+ nouns and 30K+ verbs wasn't suffiecient for some of our, and our professor's, test sentences!!!

My group and I completed this project long before discovering GitHub (Roughly Sept-Nov 2015?) and i'm just now getting around to uploading some of these old projects that I thought were kind of neat or funny.
